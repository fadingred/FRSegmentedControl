# FRSegmentedControl
FRSegmentedControl is a Cocoa control for Mac that can be used in one of two ways:

1. As a stylized radio selection
2. As a set of switches that a user can turn on and off

The project has two examples – a weekday selector and a month selector. The weekday selector is an example of the first use case, a stylized radio selection, and the month selector is an example of a set of switches that the user can turn on and off.

The FRSegmentedControl uses delegation and a datasource modeled off of UITableView.
